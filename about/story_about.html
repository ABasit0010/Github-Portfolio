    <h1>My Story</h1>

    <p>
      My journey begins in my hometown, where I completed my primary schooling in a small village.
      For elementary education, I moved to a high school in a neighboring village. Life then took an exciting turn when my family shifted to Kharian Cantonment.
      There, I joined a new school in Class 7. At that stage of my life, academics were far from my priority — I was more interested in enjoying life, playing cricket, watching movies, and spending time on mobile games.
    </p>

    <p>
      Everything changed when I was admitted to Army Public School, Kharian Cantonment.
      Initially, I continued with the same carefree attitude, but soon, a major downfall in my life forced me to reflect.
      Taking it as a challenge, I turned my life around midway through Class 8. Motivational videos, self-realization, and the will to improve pushed me to study hard.
      With the blessings of Almighty Allah, I achieved excellent results in my matriculation exams.
    </p>

    <div class="story-divider"></div>

    <p>
      I then moved on to college life at Kharian Academy, where I studied FSc Pre-Engineering.
      During this period, the COVID-19 pandemic disrupted education globally, but I still managed to perform well in my exams.
      After FSc, I made the bold decision to pursue a career in the Pakistan Army through the PMA Long Course.
      Unfortunately, I was unable to make it through due to medical and confidence-related reasons.
      This cost me a year, which I mostly spent on fitness, cricket, and leisure activities.
    </p>

    <div class="story-divider"></div>

    <p>
      Eventually, I decided to return to academics. My goal was clear — I wanted to study at the College of Electrical & Mechanical Engineering (EME), NUST, Islamabad.
      Without much preparation, I appeared in the NET exams and secured my place in the Batch of 2022 at EME.
      However, I did not get a hostel seat due to the allocation system, and I had to live in a private hostel.
      The environment there was not academically encouraging, and in my first semester, I struggled.
      After midterms, I realized I was at the edge of losing what I had worked so hard for, and I started putting in more effort.
      Still, my first semester results were below expectations.
    </p>


    <div class="story-divider"></div>

    <p>
      Learning from that experience, I completely changed my approach in the second semester — focusing on consistent study, understanding the semester system, and making use of available resources.
      My hard work paid off with excellent results.
      During the summer break, I took additional courses and previewed upcoming subjects for the third semester, which greatly helped me maintain strong performance.
      From that point onward, my academic journey has been going smoothly, Alhamdulillah, with the support of my parents' prayers and my dedication.
    </p>

    <div class="story-divider"></div>

    <p>
      Now, as I enter my final year, I am excited to work on my Final Year Project (FYP) alongside my senior-year courses.
      I believe this stage will shape my career path and strengthen my expertise in my chosen field.
    </p>

    <div class="story-divider"></div>

    <p>
      On a personal note, I would describe myself as a mix of introvert and extrovert — shy at first, but opening up after a few interactions.
      I value meaningful connections and prefer to understand a person’s character before building a relationship.
      I am a motivated individual who aspires to inspire others.
      Humor and positivity are part of my personality, and I strive to maintain a joyful outlook on life.
