    <h2>Abstract</h2>
    <p>
      This project involved the complete design, fabrication, and testing of a custom ATmega32 development board.
      The board was built to serve as a versatile microcontroller platform for embedded system projects, allowing for quick prototyping and experimentation.
      It integrates essential hardware components, power regulation, and I/O accessibility, making it suitable for both educational and practical applications.
    </p>

    <h2>Objectives</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Design a custom PCB layout for the ATmega32 microcontroller.</li>
      <li>Fabricate the PCB using FR4 substrate and ferric chloride (FeCl₃) etching.</li>
      <li>Assemble and solder all components, ensuring reliable connectivity.</li>
      <li>Test, debug, and verify the functionality of the board.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Key Features</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Custom PCB layout optimized for ATmega32 DIP package.</li>
      <li>On-board power supply with regulated 5V output.</li>
      <li>ISP (In-System Programming) header for easy firmware uploading.</li>
      <li>Multiple GPIO headers for peripheral interfacing.</li>
      <li>Crystal oscillator circuit for precise clocking.</li>
      <li>Reset circuitry with push-button control.</li>
      <li>Indicator LEDs for power and status monitoring.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Design & Fabrication Process</h2>
    <p>
      The PCB layout was created using PCB design software, with careful routing to minimize noise and ensure clean power delivery.
      The design was then printed on glossy paper and transferred to the copper-clad FR4 board.
      Ferric chloride solution was used for the etching process, followed by drilling component holes and cleaning the board surface.
      Components including the ATmega32 microcontroller, voltage regulator, headers, and passive components were soldered.
      The assembled board underwent continuity testing before applying power.
    </p>

    <h2>Testing & Verification</h2>
    <p>
      A simple LED blinking program was uploaded via ISP to confirm microcontroller functionality.
      All GPIO pins were tested for proper digital I/O operation.
      The power regulation circuitry provided a stable 5V output under different loads.
    </p>

    <h2>Applications</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Educational tool for learning embedded systems.</li>
      <li>Base platform for robotics projects.</li>
      <li>IoT device prototyping with external modules (Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, etc.).</li>
      <li>Custom automation control systems.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <p>
      The ATmega32 development board was successfully designed, fabricated, and tested.
      It provides a stable, modular, and expandable platform for microcontroller-based applications.
      The project strengthened PCB design, fabrication, and embedded system integration skills.
